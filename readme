#Spam Classifier using NLP 


In this repo I have done Spam classifier using Natural Language Processing . This is my first project in NLP . 

 NLP techniques used like 
       tokenization ,
       stemming , 
       lemmatization , 
       Bag of Words ,
       Tf-idf.
Model is trained using Naive bayes classifier       
       
I have used colab for this project . spam_classifier_using_NLP.ipynb contains the code        

Dataset used in this repo is from UCI Machine Learning Repository - SMS Spam Collection dataset
